## 📊 Database Statistics

After running `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`:
- **85 Products** created
- **335 Product Images** total
- **Average: ~4 images per product** (1 primary + 2-4 additional)

## 🎯 How to Use

### Creating a Product with Multiple Images

1. Go to **Admin Panel → Products → Create Product**
2. Fill in product details
3. Enter **Main Image URL** (required)
4. In **Additional Images** textarea, enter URLs like:
   ```
   https://picsum.photos/800/801
   https://picsum.photos/800/802
   https://picsum.photos/800/803
   ```
5. Click **Create Product**

### Editing Product Images

1. Go to **Admin Panel → Products → Edit Product**
2. See current images displayed
3. Modify **Main Image URL**
4. Update **Additional Images** textarea:
   - Add new URLs (one per line)
   - Remove unwanted URLs
   - URLs are automatically loaded from database
5. Click **Update Product**

### Viewing Image Count

- In the products list, each product shows an "Images" badge
- Badge displays total count: "3 img(s)", "5 img(s)", etc.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Relationships

```php
// Product Model
public function images() {
    return $this->hasMany(ProductImage::class);
}

// ProductImage Model
public function product() {
    return $this->belongsTo(Product::class);
}
```

### Image Data Structure

Each product has:
- **1 Primary Image**: `is_primary = true`, `order = 0`
- **N Additional Images**: `is_primary = false`, `order = 1,2,3...`

### Transaction Safety

Both create and update operations use database transactions:
```php
DB::beginTransaction();
try {
    // Create/Update product
    // Create/Update images
    DB::commit();
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    DB::rollBack();
    return error message
}
```

## ✨ Features

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
