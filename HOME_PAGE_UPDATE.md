# Home Page Dynamic Data Update

## Summary
Updated the home page to display dynamic data from the database instead of static placeholders, while keeping the hero section's large background image unchanged.

## Changes Made

### 1. Featured Brands Section
- **Before**: Not displayed
- **After**: Now displays brands from the database using `$featuredBrands`
- Shows brand logos or names
- Links to individual brand pages
- Only displays if brands exist in the database

### 2. Special Offer Cards Section
- **Before**: Static placeholder cards with generic text
- **After**: Dynamic cards displaying:
  - Active offers from the database (`$activeOffers`)
  - Offer banner images (or placeholder if not available)
  - Offer names and descriptions
  - Links to individual offer pages
  - Falls back to "On Sale" and "New Arrivals" cards if fewer than 4 offers exist

### 3. Builder Cards Section (Now "Shop by Category")
- **Before**: Static "Build Your Dream Setup" cards with hardcoded images
- **After**: Dynamic category cards displaying:
  - Category names from the database
  - Product count for each category
  - Category images (if available)
  - Links to filtered product pages by category
  - Only displays if at least 5 categories exist

### 4. New Product Sections Added
- **Bestsellers Section**: Displays bestselling products (`$bestsellerProducts`)
- **On Sale Section**: Displays products currently on sale (`$onSaleProducts`)
- Both sections use the same product card layout as Featured and New Arrivals

### 5. Controller Update
- Updated `HomeController.php` to fetch 10 categories instead of 6
- This ensures enough categories for the "Shop by Category" section

## What Was Kept Unchanged

### Hero Section
- Large background image remains static as requested
- Background gradient and styling unchanged
- Text content remains the same
- "Shop Now" button still functional

### Categories Section
- Already using dynamic data from `$categories`
- No changes needed

### Featured Products Section
- Already using dynamic data from `$featuredProducts`
- No changes needed

### New Arrivals Section
- Already using dynamic data from `$newProducts`
- No changes needed

## Data Flow

All dynamic data is passed from the `HomeController@index` method:
- `$categories` - Active parent categories
- `$featuredBrands` - Featured brands
- `$activeOffers` - Currently active offers
- `$featuredProducts` - Featured products
- `$newProducts` - New products
- `$bestsellerProducts` - Bestselling products
- `$onSaleProducts` - Products on sale

## Fallback Behavior

The page intelligently handles cases where data might not be available:
- Sections only display if data exists (using `@if` conditions)
- Placeholder images used when product/offer images are missing
- Alternative cards shown in Special Offers if fewer than 4 offers exist

## Testing

To test the updated home page:
1. Ensure database is seeded with sample data
2. Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000
3. Verify all sections display dynamic content
4. Check that hero section background image is unchanged

## Files Modified

1. `resources/views/home.blade.php` - Main view file
2. `app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php` - Controller (category limit updated)

## Caches Cleared

- View cache: `php artisan view:clear`
- Config cache: `php artisan config:clear`
