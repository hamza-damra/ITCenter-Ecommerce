# Offer Detail View Creation

## Issue
The application was throwing an `InvalidArgumentException` error when trying to access an offer detail page:
```
View [offer-detail] not found.
```

## Root Cause
The `OfferController@show` method was trying to return a view called `offer-detail`, but this view file didn't exist in the `resources/views/` directory.

## Solution
Created a new comprehensive `offer-detail.blade.php` view file with the following features:

### 1. Offer Hero Section
- Attractive gradient background with modern design
- Displays offer name, description, and badge
- Shows validity dates (start and end)
- Displays discount information (percentage or fixed amount)
- Live countdown timer showing days, hours, minutes, and seconds until offer expires

### 2. Offer Statistics Cards
- **Products in Offer**: Total count of products included
- **Discount Value**: Shows percentage or fixed amount
- **Minimum Purchase**: If applicable
- **Days Remaining**: Calculated days until offer ends

### 3. Products Grid Section
- Displays all products associated with the offer
- Product cards include:
  - Product image
  - Discount badge showing offer discount
  - Product status badge (NEW/HOT)
  - Category name
  - Product title and brand
  - Original price and sale price
  - Savings percentage calculation
  - View and Add to Cart buttons
- Empty state message if no products are available

### 4. Interactive Features
- Live countdown timer using JavaScript
- Clickable product cards that navigate to product detail pages
- Hover effects on all interactive elements
- Responsive design for mobile devices

### 5. Styling Features
- Modern gradient backgrounds
- Glassmorphism effects on countdown timer
- Card-based layout with shadows
- Color-coded badges for different information types
- Fully responsive grid layouts

## Technical Details

### View File Location
`resources/views/offer-detail.blade.php`

### Data Required
The view expects an `$offer` variable with the following relationships loaded:
- `products` (with `brand` and `category` relationships)

### Controller Method
```php
public function show($slug)
{
    $offer = Offer::with(['products.brand', 'products.category'])
        ->where('slug', $slug)
        ->firstOrFail();

    if (!$offer->isValid()) {
        abort(404, 'This offer is no longer available.');
    }

    return view('offer-detail', compact('offer'));
}
```

### Route
```php
Route::get('/offer/{slug}', [OfferController::class, 'show'])->name('offer.show');
```

## JavaScript Functionality

### Countdown Timer
- Updates every second
- Shows days, hours, minutes, and seconds
- Automatically displays "OFFER EXPIRED" when time runs out
- Uses the offer's end date from the database
- Properly formatted with leading zeros

## Responsive Design
- Desktop: Full-width hero with side-by-side stats
- Tablet: Adjusted grid layouts
- Mobile: Stacked layouts, smaller countdown items

## Integration Points

### Links to Other Pages
- Product cards link to individual product detail pages
- "View" button on each product
- "Add to Cart" button (ready for cart functionality)

### Database Relationships Used
- `$offer->products` - All products in the offer
- `$product->category` - Product category
- `$product->brand` - Product brand
- `$offer->discount_type` - Type of discount (percentage/fixed)
- `$offer->discount_value` - Discount amount

## Testing
1. Visit any offer URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/offer/{slug}`
2. Check that countdown timer is working
3. Verify all products are displayed
4. Test product card clicks
5. Confirm responsive design on different screen sizes

## Cache Cleared
- `php artisan view:clear` - Cleared compiled views
- `php artisan route:clear` - Cleared route cache

## Status
âœ… Issue resolved - Offer detail page is now fully functional with a modern, feature-rich design.
